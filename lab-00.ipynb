    "Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "- 🤖 Agent Definition: Each agent is carefully designed with a clear role, goal, and backstory that align with their unique strengths and expertise. This alignment allows the agent to approach tasks with a deep understanding of their responsibilities and objectives. For more information, refer to the full list of [agent's attributes](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#agent-attributes).\n",
    "- ✅ Task Specification: Tasks are explicitly tailored to each agent’s capabilities, with well-defined description and expected_output attributes. This clarity allows agents to work independently, producing high-quality deliverables without requiring additional guidance. Refer to the complete list of [task's attributes](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tasks#task-attributes) for detailed task configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔋 This setup creates a streamlined workflow by establishing a one-to-one mapping between agents and tasks, minimizing overlap and redundancy. Each agent focuses solely on their assigned task, resulting in a structured, organized, and effective process that promotes high-quality outcomes."

    "## Single Agent, Multiple Tasks Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, we adopt a **single-agent, multi-task** framework, where one agent is equipped to manage several tasks. This structure capitalizes on the agent's flexibility and adaptability, enabling them to handle multiple responsibilities efficiently within a defined scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔋 **Enhanced Workflow**: With this setup, the workflow remains dynamic and streamlined, as one agent can oversee multiple related tasks without needing frequent reconfiguration running tasks with dependency (`context`) and parallel (`async_execution`). This centralization keeps tasks organized and cohesive, ensuring consistent quality across all deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Implementations:\n",
    "- **LLM Integration**: Modify LLMs to power the agent, using CrewAI’s LiteLLM to access a range of LLMs (see [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)). For this setup, we’ll use Groq and Anthropic.\n",
    "- **Code writing agents**: Enable code execution for the agent, but it requires Docker to be install on safe mode.\n",
    "- **Planning Models**: Incorporate models to facilitate task planning.\n",
    "- **Memory**: Add memory functionality to enhance task continuity and context retention."
